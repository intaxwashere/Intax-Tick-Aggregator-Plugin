# Intax Tick Aggregator Plugin

This plugin is incomplete and just exist to let people I passionately work on this repo.

You can still check the files to get the general idea of how tick aggregation works and read the comments.

Right now I'm not happy with overall design choices I made, I'm looking for a ✨ magical ✨ way to register tick objects automatically to the subsystem. Until that day comes, I won't be updating this repo. Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas.
